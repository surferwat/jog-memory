<body><h2>What is required in order for a programming language to be considered an object oriented programming language?</h2><ul><li>Encapsulation, which is the ability to restrict access to an object's internal properties (i.e., hide class' implementation)</li><li>Inheritance</li><li>Polymophism, which can be loosely defined as the ability to have several different functions with the same name. Usually it refers to the ability to have several different functions with the same name AND have C++ figure out which one to call at run-time using a technique called late binding or run-time binding.</li></ul><p>Date created: 2021/12/03Date updated: 2021/12/03References:* CS 2B by David Harden Lesson 18</p></body>
